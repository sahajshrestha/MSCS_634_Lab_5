**Comparison of Clustering Algorithms**:

- **Agglomerative Clustering** formed three well-defined clusters, which align relatively well with the actual wine classes. The dendrogram provided insight into the hierarchical structure and supported the selection of 3 clusters.
- **DBSCAN** struggled with this dataset using `eps=1.5` and `min_samples=5`, labeling all points as noise (`-1`). This resulted in a silhouette score of -1, indicating a failure to form valid clusters.

**Insights**:
- Parameter tuning is crucial. DBSCAN is highly sensitive to `eps` and `min_samples`.
- Hierarchical clustering is effective when the expected number of clusters is known.
- DBSCAN is good for finding arbitrarily shaped clusters and noise points but failed in this case due to tight grouping of data.

**Challenges**:
- Selecting `eps` for DBSCAN was difficult without domain knowledge or trial-and-error.
- Silhouette score is not reliable for DBSCAN if only one cluster or mostly noise is detected.

**Conclusion**:
- For this dataset, hierarchical clustering performed better and gave meaningful structure.
- DBSCAN would need more tuning or a different preprocessing approach to perform competitively.
